# Care Circle - Code Refactoring Log

## Initial Project Setup (2024-10-23)

### Scaffolding and Structure
**Date**: 2024-10-23
**Changes Made**:
- Created Expo TypeScript project with blank template

- Set up folder structure: `src/lib/`, `src/navigation/`, `src/screens/`, `src/components/`, `src/validation/`, `src/types/`
- Created placeholder files for all screens and components
- Configured NativeWind with Tailwind CSS
- Set up Babel and Metro configuration for NativeWind

**Rationale**: Established clean project structure following React Native best practices with TypeScript, proper navigation setup, and utility-first CSS approach.

### Navigation Architecture
**Date**: 2024-10-23
**Changes Made**:
- Created `AppNavigator.tsx` with stack navigation
- Implemented authentication flow with conditional navigation
- Set up navigation types with `RootStackParamList`
- Added placeholder navigation logic for all screens

**Rationale**: Centralized navigation logic with proper TypeScript support and authentication state management.

### Component Structure
**Date**: 2024-10-23
**Changes Made**:
- Created consistent component structure across all screens
- Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Added placeholder Firebase integration points
- Created reusable components: `CircleCard`, `UpdateCard`

**Rationale**: Established consistent patterns for component development with clear separation of concerns and TypeScript safety.

### Validation System
**Date**: 2024-10-23
**Changes Made**:
- Set up Zod validation schemas for all forms
- Created type-safe validation with proper error handling
- Implemented form validation patterns across screens
- Added validation for user input, circle creation, updates, and invites

**Rationale**: Centralized validation logic with type safety and consistent error handling patterns.

### Styling System
**Date**: 2024-10-23
**Changes Made**:
- Configured NativeWind with custom Tailwind theme
- Set up consistent color palette and spacing
- Implemented mobile-first responsive design
- Added utility classes for common patterns

**Rationale**: Established consistent design system with utility-first approach for maintainable styling.

## Future Refactoring Plans

### Phase 1: Firebase Integration
**Planned Changes**:
- Replace placeholder Firebase logic with actual implementation
- Implement proper error handling for Firebase operations
- Add offline support with Firestore persistence
- Optimize Firestore queries for performance

**Rationale**: Move from placeholder to production-ready Firebase integration with proper error handling and offline support.

### Phase 2: State Management
**Planned Changes**:
- Implement React Context for global state management
- Add Redux Toolkit for complex state management
- Create custom hooks for data fetching
- Implement proper loading and error states

**Rationale**: Centralize state management for better data flow and user experience.

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
**Planned Changes**:
- Implement React.memo for expensive components
- Add virtualization for large lists
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Implement proper memory management

**Rationale**: Improve app performance and user experience with optimized rendering and memory usage.

### Phase 4: Security Hardening
**Planned Changes**:
- Implement comprehensive Firestore security rules
- Add input sanitization and validation
- Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Add audit logging for security events

**Rationale**: Ensure data security and prevent abuse with comprehensive security measures.

### Phase 5: Testing Implementation
**Planned Changes**:
- Add unit tests for all components
- Implement integration tests for Firebase operations
- Add end-to-end tests for user flows
- Create test utilities and mocks

**Rationale**: Ensure code quality and reliability with comprehensive testing coverage.

## Refactoring Guidelines

### When to Refactor
- When files exceed 200-300 lines
- When duplicate code is identified
- When performance issues are detected
- When security vulnerabilities are found
- When code becomes difficult to maintain

### Refactoring Process
1. **Identify**: Identify code that needs refactoring
2. **Plan**: Create detailed refactoring plan
3. **Test**: Ensure existing functionality works
4. **Refactor**: Make incremental changes
5. **Verify**: Test refactored code thoroughly
6. **Document**: Update documentation and comments

### Code Quality Metrics
- **File Length**: Keep files under 300 lines
- **Function Length**: Keep functions under 50 lines
- **Complexity**: Use cyclomatic complexity metrics
- **Duplication**: Eliminate code duplication
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain high test coverage
