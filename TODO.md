## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Security Requirements
- Only circle members can read/write updates or media
- Invites handled only by Cloud Functions
- Strip photo EXIF before upload
- Max 2,000 characters per update
- Throttle repeated posts
- Rate limit all API endpoints
- Use row-level security (RLS)
- Add captcha on auth routes
- Enable attack challenge on WAF

### Data Model (Firestore)
```
users/{userId}:
  displayName, photoURL, expoPushToken, createdAt

circles/{circleId}:
  title, ownerId, members[], createdAt

updates/{updateId}:
  circleId, authorId, text, photoURL?, createdAt, reactions?

invites/{inviteId}:
  circleId, createdBy, expiresAt, dynamicLink?
```

### Cloud Functions
- `createInvite` ‚Üí creates dynamic link and invite doc
- `acceptInvite` ‚Üí validates invite, adds user to members[]
- `onUpdateCreated` ‚Üí sends push notifications to all members except author

### UX Tone
- Soft, caring visuals (muted blues/greys, rounded corners)
- Friendly copy ("Share an update", not "Submit post")
- Clear consent message before joining a circle

1. Set up Firebase project and environment variables
2. Implement authentication flow
3. Create basic circle functionality
4. Add invite system with dynamic links
